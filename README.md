# PythonTask

This has been submitted as an assignment.

#### Task 1:
Read file "data.json", and write a recursive function to convert every value of key "quantity" to 23gm, 50gm and 260gm, presently data is given for 100gm.

#### Task 2:
Write a custom random number generation algo which should be 73% biased to the higher number. Like if I want ‘a random number between 1 to 10’ 100 times then it should give ‘number more than 5’ 73 times and ‘less than 5’ 27 times. You’re not allowed to use any predefined random number generation function nor use of any kind of third party library to generate random number.
